        <p class="para">An application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party developers and business partners, or to departments within their companies. This allows services and
            products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a documented interface. Programmers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products
            and services. API use has surged over the past decade, to the degree that many of the most popular web applications today would not be possible without APIs.</p>
